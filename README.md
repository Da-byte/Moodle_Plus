To setup and run locally:

Download node.
Download yarn.
Download code and open it in an IDE.
Run "yarn install" in the terminal to install dependencies.
Run "yarn start" to start the local server and use the web app.

The server is in Firebase but the app credentials have been removed for privacy. Replace them with your own to run the server with the app.
Initially I wanted to create a Django backend and then I thought of using Flask but because this was an university assignment with a short deadline and the coding of the actual website needed to be more front-end oriented I focused on that.

For future iterations: Flask backend - Run these commands to start the local server - not used in the actual app: pip install flask cd api venv\Scripts\activate flask run
